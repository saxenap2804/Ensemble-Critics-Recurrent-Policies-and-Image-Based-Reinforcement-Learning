This project implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve the inverted pendulum swing-up task. The pendulum is a continuous dynamical system with continuous state and action spaces. The primary goal is to stabilize the pendulum in the upright position using a torque applied at the pivot.

In addition to the base implementation of PPO, optional extensions are provided to explore advanced techniques such as ensemble critics, recurrent policies, and image-based observations.
